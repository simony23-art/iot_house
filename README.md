# Smart Home Automation System â€“ Licence Final Project

This project presents a complete smart house system using microcontrollers (ESP32 and Arduino Uno), various environmental sensors, actuators (servo motors, relays), and cloud connectivity via the Arduino IoT Cloud platform.

It includes modules for garage automation, smart locks, environmental control, lighting, water level monitoring, gas/flame detection, and more. The goal is to enhance home automation using affordable components and ensure remote monitoring and control through the Internet of Things (IoT).
